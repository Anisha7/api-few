# API Project: Using the Web Audio API to create a Music Maker!

## What is the Web Audio API?

This API provides a system to control audio on the web by choosing sources, adding effects, creating visualizations, and more.
It uses an audio context, which has a modular design that allows the flexibility for complex audio functions, using audio nodes and different types of channel layouts.

## Features used in this Project

# Audio Context
This controls the creation of nodes and the execution of audio processing/decoding.
It must be created before anything else for this API to function because everything happens inside the audio context.

    
# Oscillator Node
This represents a periodic waveform that causes a specified frequency of a wave to be created.
Its' methods can be used to create different waves and frequencies, with a timer to start and stop playing the tune.
This allows for the Web Audio API to do its job: play sounds.

# Gain Node
This represents a change in volume. This is used to modify volume, inceasing it, muting it, or decreasing it.
